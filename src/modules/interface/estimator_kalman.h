 * The Kalman filter implemented in this file is based on the papers:
 *
 * "Fusing ultra-wideband range measurements with accelerometers and rate gyroscopes for quadrocopter state estimation"
 * http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7139421
 *
 * and
 *
 * "Kalman filtering with an attitude" as published in the PhD thesis "Increased autonomy for quadrocopter systems: trajectory generation, fail-safe strategies, and state estimation"
 * http://dx.doi.org/10.3929/ethz-a-010655275
 * TODO: Update the above reference once the paper has been published
 *
 * Academic citation would be appreciated.
